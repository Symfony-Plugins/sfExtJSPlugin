== Installation ==

Installation is only available via SVN, due to the size of the ExtJS libraries.

Move into your project directory and issue the following command:

For the latest stable version: [[BR]]
  `svn export http://svn.symfony-project.com/plugins/sfExtJSPlugin/tags/RELEASE_1_0_0/ ./plugins/sfExtJSPlugin`

For the unstable development version: [[BR]]
  `svn checkout http://svn.symfony-project.com/plugins/sfExtJSPlugin/trunk/ ./plugins/sfExtJSPlugin`

You will need to create a symlink to the web assets. From within your project's web directory, type: [[BR]]
  `ln -s ../plugins/sfExtJSPlugin/web sfExtJSPlugin`

== Notes ==

This plugin is bundled with the latest stable build of ExtJS, currently 1.1.1 -- once 2.0 comes out of RC, the plugin will be updated accordingly.
